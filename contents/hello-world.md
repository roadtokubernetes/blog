Welcome to the Road to Kubernetes!

Kubernetes is an amazing way to orchestrate Docker containers. For the uninitiated, this might sound like a complicated mess but I assure you -- you can do Kubernetes too!

The goal of this website is to help you decide if Kubernetes is right for your team/project _now_, _in the future_, or maybe even _never_. 

Over the next however many months, we&amp;amp;#x27;ll be adding all kinds of great features to help you on your quest to understanding how to wield Kubernetes with:

- Tutorials and courses
- A book (or two)
- Interviews with various industry experts
- Community Discussions
- Self-guided and automated tools for generating the relevant Kubernetes configuration files (called Manifests)

If you have any questions or suggestions please send me a tweet [@justinmitchel](https://twitter.com/justinmitchel).

Thank you for visiting and I hope to see what you build soon.

Cheers!

Justin Mitchel
